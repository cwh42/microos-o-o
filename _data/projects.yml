               By using btrfs with snapshots MicroOS uses a very space
               efficient way to store the file system's history. All the configuration
               files in `/etc` are part of the snapshot and the rollback.

               Do your rollback by rebooting to an old snapshot. Rollbacks
               have no other limits than the available storage size.

               The download source and the transfer are verified and secured
               by HTTPS. All packages and repositoreis are signed to be veridied by the
               local installer.
               In case any dependency conflicts occur during update the
               process gets cancelled to avoid an inconsistent system. In that
               case an incomplete and useless snapshot gets immediately deleted to avoid
               wasted storage capacity.
